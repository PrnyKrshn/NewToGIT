I just want to share my experience about using GIT.
It made easy for me to store my projects in an open source platform which is completely free to use.
I recommend this GIT each and every developer over the world to use it.
One of the best advantages is that our code will be reviewied by develepers in our community and also we can get resourses from open source platform provided.
